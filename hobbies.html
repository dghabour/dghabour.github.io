     <p> I have always loved to make things with my hands. I'm a crafter. You name it, I've probably tried it at some point.For a long time it was just something I did for fun or stress relief. That changed when I found out about conventions. In 2012 I started costuming. It was the only thing I hadn't yet tried- making clothes. It's called "cosplay," which stands for "costume roleplay." I spend my free time making costumes of my favorite characters  (either from scratch or by modifying thrifted clothing) and then wearing them to conventions like the University of Florida's <a href="http://swampcon.com">SwampCon</a> or Orlando's <a href="http://megaconvention.com"> MegaCon</a>. My first cosplay was The Legend of Korra's main character, Korra, the new Avatar (not pictured.) As my skills were mainly nonexistent, this outfit was made by modifying thrifted clothing with hot glue and hand sewing.</p>

       <p>Conventions vary in size and subject but the fundamentals are the same. Nerds in costume, all coming together to celebrate the things we love. Sometimes we even get to meet the actors who play our favorite characters, or even their writers. That's how I got to meet my idol, Christopher Paolini, at a little convention called Necronomicon in October 2013. That's us on the right; I'm dressed as Uhura from Star Trek. </p>
    <h3> Convention 4</h3><p> 
        <p>  Lieutenant Uhura is my favorite cosplay (some people say I look very similar to Zoe Saldana) but I also cosplay Mulan, Guinivere from the BBC show "Merlin", and Zoe Washburne from "Firefly."
