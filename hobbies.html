    <h3> Origins</h3>

     <p> I have always loved to make things with my hands. For a long time it was just something I did for fun or stress relief. That changed when I found out about conventions in 2012. It was the only thing I hadn't yet tried: making clothes. It's called "cosplay," which stands for "costume roleplay." I spend my free time making outfits of my favorite characters  (either from scratch or by modifying thrifted clothing) and then wearing them to conventions like the University of Florida's <a href="http://swampcon.com">SwampCon</a> or Orlando's <a href="http://megaconvention.com"> MegaCon</a>. My first cosplay was <em>The Legend of Korra</em>'s main character, Korra, the new Avatar (not pictured.) As my skills were mainly nonexistent, this outfit was made by modifying thrifted clothing with hot glue and hand sewing.</p>

        <p> Conventions vary in size and subject but the basics are the same. Nerds in costume, all meeting to celebrate the things we love. Costumes vary in popularity; some never get old (see: <em>Star Wars, Zelda, Doctor Who </em> and <em> Firefly</em>) and sometimes new fandoms will become very popular (see: <em> Attack on Titan</em>). It's a lot of fun meeting new people with similar interests, take pictures or ask how they made a certain prop. Some cosplayers are extremely talented and famous for their skills. Sometimes we even get to meet the actors or writers of our fandoms. That's how I got to meet William Shatner, Karl Urban and Christopher Paolini.</p>

<h3> My Cosplay Story</h3>

        <p> Cosplay is a journey. It's almost completely self-taught, and the only limits are money and your own imagination. If you can think it up, there is most likely a way to make it happen. Cosplayers help each other, sharing techniques and cheap ways to accomplish the things we see on screen. Over the last year I've been to ten conventions and finished 12 cosplays. Somewhere along the way I bought my first sewing machine. I've made more friends than I've ever had in my life, and learned so many life skills dealing with time management, budgeting, traveling to new places, and emergency day-of-the-con prop-fixing. 
        
        <p> The greatest thing about cosplay is there is always room for improvement. I first attempted Bellatrix when I only had a few months of experience; a year later I remade her outfit with a proper wig and it turned out much better. Right now, Lieutenant Uhura is my favorite outfit (some people say I look very similar to Zoe Saldana) so I'm working on revamping her cosplay. I also recently finished Zoe Washburne from <em> Firefly</em> After that, some anime work, maybe Katara from <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>. The possibilities are endless. It's truly been amazing, and I cannot wait to see what I can learn and accomplish in the future.
