 <h3>“Wind howled through the night, carrying a scent that would change the wold."</h3>

<p>Christopher Paolini wrote that dramatic sentence – the first sentence of his first novel, Eragon, which was published when he was 15. I found Eragon at a book fair when I was 12, and that’s when I decided if he could do it - publish a book as a young adult - I could too. My ambition as a writer was born.</p>
<p>I read voraciously my whole life. My mother was a librarian so we had no shortage of books. No shopping trip was complete without a stop at either Barnes & Noble or the library. My summers included races to see how many books I could read in a month (my record was something like 22.) I learned to appreciate what a story could do for me—take me out of myself—and teach me something in the process.</p>
<p>Fast forward to freshman year of high school, when my adviser first suggested I join the newspaper staff. I was hesitant at first; I liked creative writing, and news sounded dull. But I joined anyway, and discovered that my love for telling stories applied beautifully. I learned how to write concisely in the inverted pyramid style and how to interview sources. I was assigned a page first thing, so I learned InDesign and basic Photoshop as well. By 2012 I was editor-in-chief of The Terrapin Times, in charge of assigning stories, keeping everyone on deadline, page layout, writing and also teaching 10 new recruits how to do it all as well. By the end of high school I knew that it was journalism I wanted to pursue. Creative writing became a side project as I learned new styles of news and feature writing. </p>
<p>After high school I interned with a local paper, The Osprey Observer, where I learned how to keep up with community news, travel for interviews and take better photos. Now, I’ve flown through Reporting, published some work and even incorporated multimedia elements into some of them. I’m halfway through my journalism journey at the University of Florida, working on stretching my skills so I’ll be ready to tackle the world when I graduate.</p>
<p>Eight years and three well-loved copies of Eragon later, something amazing happened. As I was looking up local conventions for the season, I stumbled across a tiny one near USF. And the guest of honor was none other than Christopher Paolini himself. Fate was kind to me, and on October 19, 2013 I got to march right up to my idol and thank him for inspiring me all those years ago. He blessed me in the ancient language of Eragon and encouraged me to continue with my writing dreams.</p>
<p>I am determined to do just that.</p>
