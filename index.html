 <h3>“Wind howled through the night, carrying a scent that would change the world.”</h3>

<p>Hounding first sentence, huh? Christopher Paolini wrote that – the first sentence of his first novel, <em> Eragon</em>, which was published when he was 15. I found <em>Eragon</em> at a book fair when I was 12, and that’s when I decided if he could do it, I could too. My ambition as a writer was born.</p>

<p>I read voraciously my whole life—my mother was a librarian so we had no shortage of books. No shopping trip was complete without a stop at either Barnes & Noble or the library. My summers were marked by races to see how many books I could read in a month (my record was something like 22.) I learned to appreciate what a story could do for me—take me out of myself—and teach me something in the process.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2010, when my high school adviser first suggested I join the newspaper staff. I was hesitant at first; I liked creative writing, and news sounded dull. But I joined anyway, and discovered that my love for telling stories applied beautifully. By 2012 I was editor-in-chief of The Terrapin Times, and I knew that it was journalism I wanted to pursue. Creative writing became a side project as I pursued news and feature writing. </p>

<p>After high school I interned with a local paper, The Osprey Observer, where I had 10 articles published.  And now I’m halfway through my journalism journey at the University of Florida, working on all a matter of skills so I’ll be ready to tackle the world when I graduate.</p>

<p>Eight years and three well-loved copies of <em>Eragon</em> later, something amazing happened. As I was looking up local conventions for the season, I stumbled across a tiny one near USF. And the guest of honor was none other than Christopher Paolini himself. Fate was kind to me, and on October 19, 2013 I got to march right up to my idol and thank him for inspiring me all those years ago. He blessed me in the ancient language of <em> Eragon</em> and encouraged me to continue with my writing dreams.</p>

<p>I am determined to do just that.</p>
